****Introduction*****
The purpose of this analysis is to ascertain the target population, peak times, and probability of success for implementation of a bike-sharing program in Des Moines based on the pre-existing bike-sharing program in New York City.  This analysis will look at the population demographics, ride duration, time of ride, day of week, and number of trips in order to provide a meaningful outcome.

****Ride Duration****
The majority of people usually check out the bike for 5 minutes.  At the 5 minute mark the maximum of 146,752 bikes were checked out. The majority of rides, amounting to 1.8 million bikes, are taken for 20 minutes or less compared to the slightly less than half million rides that take 21 - 60 minutes.
- 512,864  bikes were ridden for 1 - 5 minutes.  
- 635,056 bikes were ridden between 6 - 10 minutes. 
- 403,900 bikes were checked out between 11 - 15 minutes.  
- 263,212 bikes were ridden between 16 - 20 minutes.  
- The remaining rides totalled nearly a half million that were ridden between 21 - 60 minutes.

****Day of Week and Peak Times****
The most consistent trips are taken during commuting hours between 8 - 9 am during the week days and between 5 - 7 pm M, Th, Th.  Specifically of those time periods Thursday 5 - 7 pm is the busiest time during the entire week.  The rides build up to and drop off slightly after these hours with the lowest amount of rides being taken on weekdays from 11 pm - 5 am.  On weekends, though it is less than during commuting hours on the week day the busiest time is 12 pm Saturday, but there is less disparity during daytime hours in general on Saturday and Sunday.  The lowest amount of rides on the weekend occur during night hours and early mornings.

****Target population****
All target populations documented: males, females, and unknown had peaks for ride duration under 15 minutes. In every ride duration, males rode more bikes than females and unknown. Females in every ride duration, females rode more bikes than the unknown.
- The majority of rides are taken by males with 108,087 bikes ridden for 5 minutes. 
- The majority of rides are taken by females with 34,151 bikes ridden for 6 minutes. 
- The majority of rides are taken by unknown with 7,389 bikes ridden for 11 minutes.
Regarding the target population and peak times, males appear to drive the peak times for bike-sharing being during the week days during commuting hours, followed by a consistent but less strong presence on the weekend.  Females also share this pattern to a lesser degree than males.  The unknown demographic had the weakest turnout but notably did not show any significant rides on during the weekdays.  

****Results****
Based on all the above it would appear that males are the target population of bike-sharing services as they partake in bike-sharing significantly more than the other genders.  Both males and females tend to utilize these bike rides during commuting hours and all genders tend to use the bike-sharing for short distances.  This is condusive to a crowded, densely populated city that doubles as a tourism destination such as New York, but I would recommend that for investors in Des Moines they review the amount of businesses and tourist attractions in their downtown compared against the square feet in which those businesses and tourist attractions exist to see if there are any similar space that are densely populated such as New York before investigating.
